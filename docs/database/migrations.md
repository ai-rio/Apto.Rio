Let me create the database migrations documentation for you:

Now all documentation files are complete! The database migrations document provides a comprehensive strategy for extending the starter kit's schema with our property-specific tables while maintaining compatibility with the existing authentication and subscription functionality.

The document covers:
1. The staged migration approach
2. Specific SQL for each migration step
3. Row Level Security policies
4. Triggers for maintaining data integrity
5. Testing and rollback strategies

This completes the full set of documentation for the Apto.rio project, providing a solid foundation for implementation.
